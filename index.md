### About Me
As the title suggests, my name is Eddie Helmick. As of writing this, I am 28 years old and have been working on my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science since I was 25. Previous to going to school, my career was in sales. I managed a large staff of employees and together we accomplished a lot. I always knew in my heart that I wanted to work in the tech world - I have a tinkerer's brain. After I achieved all of the goals I had for myself in the industry, I decided to move on to school. I was successful in finding a software engineering job after I finished up my first two years of college, and that's where I still work today. Besides my passion for work, I enjoy spending time with my friends, my dog, and my lovely soon to be wife. This journey would not have been possible without the support from these wonderful people and of course my wonderful pup.

### Education Journey and Reflection
I have learned a lot throughout my educational journey. From simple to complex mathematics, basic to advance programming concepts, software development life cycles, project management techniques, and more. The more complex the classes throughout my program became, the more I found myself analyzing details to a greater extent, working to hold myself accountable to better time management to allow for difficulties or issues that arose within the assignments, and more curious about learning beyond the bounds of the class. I feel that learning these skills was a crucial step to my continued success as the content of the program became more challenging. These gained skills will aid me in my current career, and any career choices that I make in the future. I feel that they have made me a much more analytical developer and allowed for me to be more exploratory in my answers instead of accepting the “boilerplate” solution. Instead of taking the face-valued obvious route to solutions, I now consider what challenges I might face in future iterations of a project, and what issues might arise in the current iteration. This leads to better quality code, a better user experience, and continues to make me a better software developer.

### Future Goals and Areas of Interest
