# Enhancements

##### [Self Assessment](https://edwardhelmick.github.io/index.html)  |  [Code Review](https://edwardhelmick.github.io/CodeReview.html)

For my computer science capstone at Southern New Hampshire University, I chose one artifact to focus on enhancing throughout the entire course. The artifact I chose to enhance is Travlr Getaways â€“ a web application on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node) which was worked on in my previous Full Stack Engineering class. This artifact was a great choice for this enhancement project because it is a large application with endless opportunities for creative change and improvements. I learned a lot while transforming this application and enjoyed the experience.
