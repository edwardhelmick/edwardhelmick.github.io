##### [Self Assessment](https://edwardhelmick.github.io/index.html)  |  [Code Review](https://edwardhelmick.github.io/CodeReview.html)

For my computer science capstone at Southern New Hampshire University, I chose one artifact to focus on enhancing throughout the entire course. The artifact I chose to enhance is Travlr Getaways â€“ a web application on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and Node) which was worked on in my previous Full Stack Engineering class. This artifact was a great choice for this enhancement project because it is a large application with endless opportunities for creative change and improvements. I learned a lot while transforming this application and enjoyed the experience.

### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

I decided to transform this application from a MEAN stack application to an ASP.NET application. They are very similar, but ASP.NET has a lot of great built in security functions and this application could easily be expanded in the future to include user accounts and role management. Transferring this application to a different language and web framework was a great learning experience for me. I spent time understanding how the MongoDB drivers worked differently on C#, how models were initialized differently between languages, and how to configure connection strings on the new framework. I would say the most difficult part was working through connecting my database server to the newly built application, but it was very rewarding when accomplished! The migration to a different language and framework showcases my ability to adapt quickly to change, analyze how to execute the required changes in the new environment, and learn new technologies.

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
